# Cookstove_Project

A Shiny app for tracking cooking stove use over time, intended for use by community health workers in Peru. The app calculates the average number of stove uses per day, plots the times the stoves were used in week, month, and three month intervals, and warns the user if errors with stove temperature loggers occur.
